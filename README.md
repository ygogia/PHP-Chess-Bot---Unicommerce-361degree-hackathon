# PHP Chess Bot- Team PublicStaticVoidMain #4 
This hackathon project was built by our team of three at the Unicommerce
Hackathon and we came #4 out of 49 teams in the hackathon.

Problem statement was to create three different web services and the
competition server would alternatively hit both the opponent's local
servers to get your next move as a response.

Modified Rules
1. There will be only two kings on the board.
2. Board size can be NxN 7<N<17
3. Kings cannot be at a place where they or the opponent's king have
visited before (think Knight's tour problem)
4. If no response is recieved or wrong response is received than that
team would be disqualified.

Response time around 25ms
